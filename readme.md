This project involved me implementing EMA (exponential moving average), a formula that determines what is the
average price, based on weighing the latest prices more heavily.

I built a bot that would query gdax, compare current price against the EMA, and buy, sell or hold, depending on the data.

I wanted to see if simply buying below the EMA and selling above it would net a profit over the long run. it was also a way to get better knowledge of the stock market, and building bots.
